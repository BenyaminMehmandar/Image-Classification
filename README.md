# Image Classification Problem

In this project, we focused on image classification using three Kaggle datasets. We experimented with three popular CNN architectures: ResNet18, ShuffleNet V2, and MobileNet V2, for each dataset.

The repository includes three IPython notebook files, each corresponding to one dataset and architecture. These notebooks contain the code for data processing and model training for each specific combination of dataset and architecture.

Additionally, we have provided a zip file containing all the result graphs generated during the project for easy reference.
